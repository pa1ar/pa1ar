- this is a hugo project
- it uses a Stack theme https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack
- the modification of the theme should happen in the corresponding partials placed in ./layouts
- the styling should happen in corresponding .scss files that are stored ./assets/scss
- the ./assets/scss/custom.scss is only supposed to be used for new components which are not present in the theme
