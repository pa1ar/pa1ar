> I am making an extension currently - Sumr, to summarize articles in Safari browser. Mostly for myself actually. Using it already on daily basis.

## why 
I have tried using Arc Search browser as my daily driver, but somehow I always come back to Safari. I like the way Safari works, the way it looks. But I was missing one feature - the ability to summarize articles. So after trying out existing apps, I decided to make one myself.

## notable features ::

- summary is stored locally in your browser's memory, so if you revisit the website - you can read previously created one (no need to summarize again → money saving)
- works on iOS, iPadOS and MacOS; should work on VisionOS too
- uses your own OpenAI key - no subscription, pay for what you actually used
