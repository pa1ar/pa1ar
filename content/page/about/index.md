## Summary

With the Master of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering, technical project leading experience and scientific background, I am passionate about brain-computer interfaces, wearables and integrated digitalization (e.g. in healthcare).

In my current role I am developing concepts and processes as Creative Technologist at Hyperinteractive Studios.

In my previous role as IT project lead, I built a team of 18 highly talented researchers, developers and content creators in order to create two digital products for Avenue-Pal project.

Throughout my career, I was first author of 3 scientific publications in neuroscience (spike sorting), co-authored several other publications, aimed to bring digitalization to the healthcare.

I am ready to move around the globe.
