## Summary

> I am a technical director, a generalist, and an innovation leader with over 10 years of multidisciplinary experience. 

Specializing on emerging digital technologies, I have launched more than 15 projects, applying technological solutions to real-world problems in fields like healthcare, accessibility, and social issues.

Throughout my career, I've led cross-functional teams from concept to launch, building strong client relationships and ensuring timely delivery. My leadership has contributed to works that have received over 50 international awards, including Cannes Lions and iF Design Awards. Notable projects include leading the development of [Dot Go](/projects/dot-go), an award-winning iOS app for the visually impaired, and spearheading [The Truth Wins](/projects/the-truth-wins) campaign to navigate around censorship, and [AI Eric](/projects/ai-eric), an AI relationship coach.

To hone my hard-skills, I build things hands-on myself; as a full-stack conceptualist, designer, developer, copy-writer, and assets creator. Lately I have launched a personal project - [Sumr](/projects/sumr/) — a Safari extension that summarizes web pages directly in your browser. Besides that, I have shared a couple of scripts on [GitHub](https://github.com/pa1ar).

With an M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering, I have contributed to neuroscience research and biosignal analysis by developing a [spike sorting](/projects/spike-sorting) algorithm. I also led a development team focused on improving [palliative care](/projects/avenue-pal) through technology-driven solutions.

Passionate about the human-machine synergy, I am continuously exploring new ways to leverage technology for meaningful impact. I regularly share my takes on the latest tech trends and innovations on [𝕏/twitter](https://x.com/pa1ar/).
