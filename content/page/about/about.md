## Summary

With the Master of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering, technical project leading experience, scientific and international relations background, I am driven by the endless potential of technology and innovation to bridge gaps, solve real-world problems, and enhance lives.

As a Creative Technologist at HyperInteractive Innovation Studio, I engage with teams to turn imaginative ideas into tangible solutions. Hyperinteractive's projects often sit at the crosssection of creativity and technology, aimed at solving problems or creating value for the clients. Notable projects include developing an award-winning iOS app [Dot Go](/projects/dot-go) for the visually impaired, [The Truth Wins](/projects/the-truth-wins) campaign to bypass censorship and igniting AI initiatives within the company, manifested by one of the latest projects - [AI Eric](/projects/ai-eric) relationship coach.

Earlier, I was working on projects in the field of biomedical technology, contributed to neuroscience research by developing a [spike sorting](/projects/spike-sorting) algorithm, and leading a project to improve [palliative care](/projects/avenue-pal) through tech-enabled solutions. Alongside, I've always enjoyed sharing knowledge, be it through tutoring engineering subjects in the lab of my university, leading martial arts groups for kids and adults, or introducing collaborative digital tools for perpetual knowledge management to the co-workers.

I am thrilled about the boundless potential of human-machine symbiosis, and never stop exploring new ways to harness technology for meaningful solutions.
