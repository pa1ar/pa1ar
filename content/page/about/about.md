## Summary

With the Master of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering, technical project leading experience, scientific and international relations background, I am driven by the endless potential of technology and innovation to bridge gaps, solve real-world problems, and enhance lives.

As a Creative Technologist at HyperInteractive Innovation Studio, I engage with teams to turn imaginative ideas into tangible solutions. Our projects often sit at the nexus of creativity and technology, aimed at solving problems or creating value for our clients. Notable projects include developing an award-winning iOS app Dot Go for the visually impaired and igniting AI initiatives within the company.

Earlier, I was working on biomedical engineering projects, contributing to neuroscience research, and leading a project to improve palliative care through tech-enabled solutions. Alongside, I've always enjoyed sharing knowledge, be it through tutoring engineering subjects in the lab of my university, leading martial arts groups for kids and adults, or introducing collaborative digital tools for perpetual knowledge management.

I am thrilled about the boundless potential of human-machine symbiosis, and tirelessly explore new ways to harness technology for meaningful solutions.
