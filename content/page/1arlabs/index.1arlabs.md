## What I can help you with

### LEADERSHIP & CONSULTING
I do consulting in the fields I feel the [most proficient](/cv). You can consider reaching out for a one-time consulting or a long-term partnership proposition.

**Process of consulting usually looks like this:**
1. `Understanding needs` (definition of done) 
2. `Ideate` (brainstorming, research, market analysis, etc.)
3. `Research` technical implications (feasibility & complexity)
4. `Document`: what will it take to build your solution (technical stack, timeline, team composition, cost estimation, etc.) 

**We can `go places` from there:**
- `Prototyping` (click dummy, proof of concept, depending on what you need)  
- `Briefs` for developers and designers  
- `Roadmap` with milestones  
- `Overseeing` the process of execution  
- `Organizing` QA and user tests  
- `Planning` and executing launch  
- `Report` and technical documentation

### RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 

I [launched](/projects) several [award-winning](/awards) projects, wrote and co-authored several [publications](/cv#publications), and researched probably hundreds of topics. So if you require some work to be done, here is what you can expect if you work with me:

- **`Digital innovation technology`**. You hire me to brainstorm with you on your ideas. I bring expertise and implementable ideas.
- **`AI solutions brainstorm & prototyping`.** You describe your problem, I come up with an AI solution for it and show you a proof of concept within an agreed period (ChatGPT based, multi-agent setups, ChatGPT actions creation, etc.).
- - **Rapid in-depth research** on the topic of your choice within my [sphere of competence](/skills). You tell me what you need to research, I do the research and provide full well-structured documentation starting with a short easy-to-understand explanation.
- - **`Architecture creation for your system`.** You describe me your (future) service, I provide you with a scheme of service (full plan for your upcoming solution or figuring out how your existing one works).
- - **`Rapid prototyping`.** You share with me your idea, I do the research myself and provide you with either low-fidelity prototypes in Figma, create of proof of concepts for algorithms and workflows (can be wrapped in GUI).
- **`Business and investment in Kazakhstan`** for non-Kazakhstan companies. I can guide you through processes, attend meetings, and connect you with various actors and decision-makers in Kazakhstan.
- **`Business in Germany`** for non-European companies. I can help you open a company in Germany, assist with market research, and connect you with various actors and decision-makers in fields of digital technology, advertisement, healthcare industry, academia, and education, etc.
- **`Medical technology.`** You hire me to perform market analysis and figure out the state of the art in a given medtech field.
- **`Digital efficiency`**. You have an inefficient workflow? I can analyze your needs and provide you with proven methods to improve (e.g., company and personal knowledge management, automated workflows, AI-assisted workflows, etc.).
- **`Video games`**. You hire me to test your game, I come up with prioritized, cost-effective, and actionable improvement ideas for your game. I can provide expertise evaluation for your sci-fi game (e.g., futuristic cyberpunk titles, digital security, medical devices, etc.).

Obviously, we can sign an NDA before we start working on your ideas.

### KEYNOTES & NEGOTIATIONS

- **`In-depth workshops or lectures`** about technological topics for your employees or clients. You give me a topic, which should be related to my [sphere of competence](/skills), I create a workshop/lecture for you and perform either myself or in cooperation with your team.
- **`Effective tool usage workshop.`** I can give you a workshop about how to speed up any task in your company by using state-of-the-art tools and techniques, including no-code AI assistant usage, prompt engineering, etc.
- **`Negotiations`** with potential partners, clients, or investors. You provide me with a brief, I prepare a negotiation strategy and, on demand, perform negotiations for you.

Reach out and we will figure out how we can help each other.
