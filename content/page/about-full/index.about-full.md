Previously engaged in biomedical technology, I contributed to neuroscience research by developing a [spike sorting](/projects/spike-sorting) algorithm, and leading a project to improve [palliative care](/projects/avenue-pal) through tech-enabled solutions. Alongside, I've always enjoyed sharing knowledge, be it through tutoring engineering subjects in the lab of my university, leading martial arts groups for kids and adults, or introducing collaborative digital tools for perpetual knowledge management to the co-workers.

I am thrilled about the boundless potential of human-machine symbiosis, and never stop exploring new ways to harness technology for meaningful solutions.
