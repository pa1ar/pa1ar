## Basic Apple Shortcuts
> Most shortcuts are available either on pay-what-you-want basis or as paid version in which an optional 15 minutes support call with me is included.

---
### ｢ text editing ｣ BUNDLE

> I've packed a `6 shortcuts` into a bundle to make text editing on iOS a bit more convenient.  
> I am using those shortcuts myself every single day when preparing [posts for 𝕏](https://x.com/pa1ar), texting in group chats or jotting down stuff in my notes. Maybe you will too.

{{< cta title="get ｢ text editing ｣ shortcuts BUNDLE" url="https://1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcuts-bundle-text-editing" >}}

What's included:

- [｢ count chars ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-count-chars) - output the number of characters in the input
- [｢ sort lines ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-sort-lines) - sort lines in the input
- [｢ decorate ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-decorate) - frame text by adding special characters around your input
- [｢ link_words ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-link-words) - connect words in the input with special characters
- [｢ change CASE ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-change-case) - change the case of the input (lower, upper, title, sentence, aLtErNaTiNg)
- [｢ insert date ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-insert-date) - insert current date in the format you prefer
- Optional one 15-minutes support session with me in case you need any support or have questions about the shortcuts.

*Bundle is paid, but you can get each shortcut separately for free (or pay what you find the effort is worth).*  
*There is also an option for each shortcut to get a supported version for - meaning you will get one 15 minutes support session with me if you have any questions or issues about your shortcut.*

### ｢ journal ｣ 

> Journaling is a great way to reflect on your day. The only downside - oftentimes you don't know what to write about. 
> This shortcut will help you with getting started. It will provide an `outline for your journal entry`, so you can focus on writing right away.
> It also provides weather of the day in current location to help you refresh your memory (especially useful for travellers)

## Advanced Apple Shortcuts
> These shortcuts are using more complex functions and/or API calls. I am trying to keep the dependencies on external services or apps to minimum, so you can use them without any additional costs/installations.

### ｢ API storage ｣

> This shortcut is useful for `handling API keys` which you will use in various shortcuts made by me. The keys are stored in Apple notes, so assuming you are not sharing iCloud account or not sharing the note/folder with the keys with anyone, this gives you relatively secure way of storing the keys. The shortcut is handling the note with API keys automatically, so you don’t need to modify anything manually, you only need to get the API keys from service provider and the shortcut will append it to the corresponding note.

{{< cta title="get ｢ API storage ｣ shortcut" url="https://1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-api-storage" >}}

---

### ｢ shrink IMGs ｣ API version
> This shortcut uses native on-device tools to resize image and then uses TinyPNG API to `compress images`. You can select `multiple images`, all of them will be processed with same proportions and the output format (JPEG or PNG) will also remain the same.

This shortcut is made compatible with [｢ API storage ｣](https://1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-api-storage) shortcut.

{{< cta title="get ｢ shrink IMGs ｣ API version" url="https://1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-shrink-imgs-api" >}} 

---

### ｢ shrink IMGs ｣ no API version
> This shortcut uses native `on-device tools to resize image and/or to compress images`. You can select `multiple images`, all of them will be processed with same proportions and the output format (JPG or PNG) will also remain the same for the whole batch you are processing.

This version of the shortcut can't compress PNGs. If you need this functionality, consider getting the [API version](https://1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-shrink-imgs-api).
