## Apple Shortcuts

---
### ｢ text editing ｣ BUNDLE

> I've packed a `6 shortcuts` into a bundle to make text editing on iOS a bit more convenient.  
> I am using those shortcuts myself every single day when preparing [posts for 𝕏](https://x.com/pa1ar), texting in group chats or jotting down stuff in my notes. Maybe you will too.

{{< cta title="get ｢ text editing ｣ shortcuts BUNDLE" url="https://1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcuts-bundle-text-editing" >}}

What's included:

- [｢ count chars ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-count-chars) - output the number of characters in the input
- [｢ sort lines ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-sort-lines) - sort lines in the input
- [｢ decorate ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-decorate) - frame text by adding special characters around your input
- [｢ link_words ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-link-words) - connect words in the input with special characters
- [｢ change CASE ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-change-case) - change the case of the input (lower, upper, title, sentence, aLtErNaTiNg)
- [｢ insert date ｣](1ar.gumroad.com/l/shortcut-insert-date) - insert current date in the format you prefer
- Optional one 15-minutes support session with me in case you need any support or have questions about the shortcuts.

*Bundle is paid, but you can get each shortcut separately for free (or pay what you find the effort is worth).*  
*There is also an option for each shortcut to get a supported version for - meaning you will get one 15 minutes support session with me if you have any questions or issues about your shortcut.*

### ｢ journal ｣ 

> Journaling is a great way to reflect on your day. The only downside - oftentimes you don't know what to write about. 
> This shortcut will help you with getting started. It will provide an `outline for your journal entry`, so you can focus on writing right away.
> It also provides weather of the day in current location to help you refresh your memory (especially useful for travellers)

**Get it from Gumroad:**
