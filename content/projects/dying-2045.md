## what  
How will we treat dying, death and mourning individually, socially and institutionally in 2045, how will needs and expectations develop? Will the trend towards individualization, isolation and dying in care facilities continue? What impact will digitalization have? Experts from various fields of action and scientific disciplines develop scenarios for how dying, death and mourning will be organized in the future. They open up "desirable" perspectives and show what needs to be done to make them a reality.

Chapter I was honored to work on: Digitalization, Scenarios of a digitalized society.

The book is in German, so I've decided to publish a raw, unedited by co-authors english version on my website.

2023

## so what?  
In my chapter, I predicted (the book was published in 2023, but all the drafts were ready more than year ago - editing and finalization takes time) the emergence of the next-level chatbots and their application as therapists.
