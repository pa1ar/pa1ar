## what  
"Dying in 2045" (original German: "Wie werden wir in Zukunft sterben?") offers an insightful outlook into a future where technology and society have evolved together, profoundly affecting how we live and eventually die. The book explores the deep integration of digitalization in our daily lives, touching on its historical roots and potential trajectory towards 2045. 

From book's official description:
> How will we treat dying, death and mourning individually, socially and institutionally in 2045, how will needs and expectations develop? Will the trend towards individualization, isolation and dying in care facilities continue? What impact will digitalization have? Experts from various fields of action and scientific disciplines develop scenarios for how dying, death and mourning will be organized in the future. They open up "desirable" perspectives and show what needs to be done to make them a reality.

Chapter I was honored to work on: "Digitalization, Scenarios of a digitalized society". It delves into the concept of true digitalization, distinguishing it from mere digital mimicry and underscoring its transformative impact across various domains, including healthcare, consumer trends, and end-of-life experiences.

## so what?  
"Dying in 2045" paints a vivid picture of a future where digital technology is deeply woven into our social fabric. It predicts significant transformations in healthcare, consumer behavior, and even our understanding of life and death. The book encourages readers to consider how these advancements might shape not just technology but our very humanity.  

In my chapter, I predicted (the book was published in 2023, but all the drafts were ready more than year ago - editing and finalization takes time) the emergence of the next-level chatbots and their application as therapists.
