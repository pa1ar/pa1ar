# what  
The ultimate goal of the spike sorting is to allocate a signal with a source. An algorithm which can effectively perform this task can be applied in wide variety of spheres, but we have selected as our target area the field of neuroscience. As the spike sorting is the first step to study brain and develop a brain-computer interface.  

Goal of the project: development of an easy-to-use, resource-saving and fast algorithm of spike sorting, based on the calculation of correlations of spikes’ waveforms.

# so what?  
Publication was presented by me during Automed 2018 scientific conference. The project became foundational for the series of publication, done by me and other researchers of the scientific group, e.g. to apply the algorithm for [ECG analysis](/projects/spike-sorting-ecg). The algorithm capabilities were significantly improved by introduction of the [multivariate mode](/projects/spike-sorting-multivariate/).
