# Introduction

> “How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that's so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.”
> Paul Bowles, The Sheltering Sky

The history of digitalization in Germany began long before the first computers. We could start describing it since Friedrich Clemens Gerke simplified Morse code in Hamburg back in the XIX century, but we won’t. More importantly, it's how digital technology thrives (or not) in modern times and what we can expect from the near and relatively far future in 2045.

It is worth describing the epoch of the prognosis first, as no technology exists in isolation and strongly depends on what social, political, and climate environments are. One pandemic outbreak transformed industries, made people work from home massively, and increased the speed of adoption of contactless payments. Even the vaccine itself was created in such a short time thanks to the progress in AI (Park, 2021). In 25 years, we will most probably have many black swan type of events, which would probably make all predictions irrelevant, as that is exactly the nature of such events - they are so rare and improbable, that we tend to neglect the very possibility of their occurrence. Still, it is worth trying to make an educated guess and propose an assumption, as such an exercise can show the undesirable shifts (even without major largely unpredictable incidents) in a long-term perspective, which will bring us to the future we probably would like to avoid. So after such, we could try to reflect where we took a wrong turn or a shortcut, and try to get back on course to prosperity. Or at least survival.

The target for this prognosis is the year 2045. So, Vladimir Putin is probably still president of Russia (the name might be different, the spirit is the same), Berlin's airport is still under construction, and America is trying to be great yet again. Politicians are still talking about embracing the new digital world, which is of course still a new land for all of us, and you might probably still need a fax machine from time to time to communicate with this governmental institution.

Seriously though, as we are trying to make predictions about seniority and the process of dying, it is important to understand what generation will be considered seniors in 2045. It is relatively safe to say that people will retire at a more advanced age than 67, as now. Now students tend to stay at the university considerably longer than at the beginning of the century and start working professionally even later, the fringe of retirement is going to move further and further. Considering the current declining birthrate, the government will be left with no other choice but to postpone the retirement edge. It can be proposed that “seniors of the future” will be people older than 70, maybe even 75.

If we as humanity survive another 25 years, today’s 40-45-year-olds will become these “seniors of the future”. It is a generation of people who were born in the 80s.

They were born before the internet was a thing (the invention of the internet happened in 1983), they didn’t have smartphones in school, but they know why the “save the document” button has a floppy disk icon and what sound a dial-up modem made. This is a generation of the digital revolution, lived through the web 1.0, web 2.0, and now they have entered the era of web 3.0. For sure, these people know how to adapt, and they might be almost the last generation that had time to grow some skin to actually be resilient, maybe they are the last such species on this planet. They already experienced so much in their life and they probably will witness several more revolutions down the line.

What are the traits of the generation we are talking about? There are managers (and other white-collars) among them, they are the first generation who could become true IT specialists. As soon as the internet and remote workstyle became a thing, many of them chose the path of digital nomads. They are the first generation to become self-published writers aka bloggers. They already survived one pandemic and they probably will need to overstay more lockdowns in these 25 years. They survived several economic crises and at the time of writing are trying to survive yet another one. It is too soon to state if they will be the World War III survivors, as well as the global climate crisis survivors.

Considering the weight on the shoulders of only this generation, and taking into consideration that Gen Z didn’t have a relatively calm childhood - instead, they were just thrown into the whirlwind of social media, informational noise, fear of missing out, endless anxiety, cancel culture, cryptocurrency, and pixelated pictures of apes sold at the price of a mansion - we can be absolutely sure we will have at least one societal collapse in the future years. As so many generations right now have completely opposite views, and the digital sphere makes it easier than ever to clash based on any misalignments. At that point, it wouldn’t be much of a surprise, if we would also be visited by aliens and attacked by zombies in the next 25 years.

Based on the picture we just drew, the digitalization of dying is going to fit into a very complex scenery. So we will start with observing the current stand of technology and digitalization, then take a look at trends that can be identified, and only after that will try to connect this to healthcare, medicine, and finally - dying. So basically we will use a classical spotlight and the flare method (Simi, 2020) by first going wide, trying to see the bigger picture, and then going narrow, focusing on what the book is actually about.

# Currently existing trends in technology and digitalization

Now when we describe the people we are targeting for the prognosis, it makes sense to picture the status quo of technology and digitalization. In other words, describe what our digital space looks like right now. In this section, we will first define what digitalization even means and how true digitalization opens new possibilities. Then we take a look at trends from different perspectives: from the point of view of a consumer, corporations, and healthcare providers.

## True Digitalization

Digitalization can be roughly separated into two phases - the phase of mimicking the real object and true digitalization.

Digitalization always starts with copying the existing object or process and transferring it as-is to the digital space. Since the screen became capable of displaying more or less realistic pictures, the user interfaces tried to mimic real objects. Virtually every reading app used a wooden bookshelf background to help users make a clear connection between a real object and an action and a virtual analogy of them. So, the abstraction level at first is always low in order to ensure a higher adoption rate.

An example of such a mimicking phase of digitalization was the way newspapers tried to adapt to the new reality by keeping the classic newspaper format and spreading the magazines over PDF. While some journals and magazines managed to keep this way of spreading their issues, the majority of the press embraced the new format.

Unfortunately, too many apps ignore the usability and reading experience of their customers. In certain industries, this is more prominent than in others. For example, apps of the telecommunication and insurance providers often look like a proper app at first glance, but every attempt to go deeper in any of the subcategories reveals the true nature of such apps - those are just website wrappers, meaning that the content is not part of the app itself but is just accessed over the internet as every browser would do. That alone is a sufficient reason not to use these apps in the first place and just stick to a provider’s webpage, as it is unclear why bother downloading the app if there are no advantages to using such. Developers of such apps would argue that this approach saves costs, but what would save costs even more is not to do this app at all. Moreover, the absolute majority of the apps in the same industry will ask the user to download a PDF to see the contract details or the latest invoice. This is another shortcut and shows nothing but the laziness of developers and the indifference of executive and strategy managers about the service they provide.

To this day, some magazines are spreading their issues via PDF. To me, that either means the issuer didn’t bother compiling a proper and readable version of the content on the website, doesn’t understand how to sell digital content effectively, or they are targeting a very niche target audience, who has certain needs (and they probably don’t have resources to support both PDF and HTML versions of the content). For the majority of people, content formatted in an adaptive way (which looks good on both bigger and smaller screens) is the most comfortable way of reading (about 59% of the traffic on the internet is associated with smartphones). Reading a PDF on mobile is a very special kind of pleasure, and not every user enjoys it, to say the least. Significantly fewer people prefer desktop (about 39% of traffic) - these users can bear reading PDFs because of larger screens. According to statistics, a marginally low amount of traffic on the internet is associated with tablets (less than 2%) - and tablets are probably the only type of devices which provides a decent reading experience for PDF reading. The last number can be a bit off though, as users on tablets might just as well use desktop versions of the websites and therefore be recognized as desktop users, which may shift statistics towards desktops.

True digitalization means that the process passed this first mimicking phase, is detached from physical limitations, and utilizes the full potential of being virtual. True digitalization does not happen in isolation, meaning that the world surrounding the object or a process also should change. For newspapers and magazines, that means switching to a format suitable for devices users actually use, considering the screen types and matching the fonts and layouts, which look best on those certain screens.

> The concept of writing has changed with the change in technology. Writing has always adapted to the tools currently in use - cuneiform was born not because of the aesthetics of the straight lines but because of the necessity to use sharp tools on a firm surface. Then there were scrolls - with the trait of being long and relatively compact, the limitation was that they weren’t really convenient to produce in masses. Another inconvenience was with the increase in the length of written materials - it is not particularly convenient to index endless pieces of paper and reference parts of it. Traditional boxy books appeared and tried to fix the indexing problem with pagination and chapters. The duplication of a handwritten book was so time-consuming that even a cumbersome printing press was a better solution. Portable consumer-level typewriters shrank the size of the most widespread paper to A4 or letter size, and that is what digital writing of today inherited and mostly uses to date. Only in the very recent years, when the paperless culture started to spread, did consumers start to use an endless canvas for typing. An endless canvas possesses several traits of a digital space - it allows the creation of documents in various forms, depending on what the user tries to showcase or emphasize. For example, the Prezi presentation tool uses scaling and scrolling instead of switching slides and therefore provides the ability to show the bigger picture without hacks and tricks.

Digitalization also solved the indexing problem with hyperlinks (and bidirectional links), which allow citing and pointing to any point in a document, and basically, hyperlinks are still the backbone of the internet. Funnily enough, initially created to make scientific publications more interactive and up-to-date, the hyperlinks and the internet itself were able to revolutionize almost everything but science. Papers are still submitted in a strict format - A4, often black and white, and the publications are also published and accessed in PDF (portable document format). That has obvious drawbacks, like the inability to create interactive plots or embed videos, which could help researchers visualize the idea in a significantly better way. One might argue that the current standard of publication makes those very standardized and therefore relatively easily readable - readers can expect a solid publication to have a scientific structure - but that is actually not an issue whatsoever, as it is absolutely possible to enforce the submission of structured documents without the limits of an A4 piece of paper. Many software solutions do a great job of limiting the usage of decorative tools and therefore providing a unified look to all documents produced by the tool. A combination of LaTeX with limitless canvas and interactive tables or plots would make the whole difference in the way humanity publishes the results of scientific research.

One of the current trends in document production and note-taking are bidirectional links and block quotes (or synchronized blocks), which allow the creation of a network of interconnected pieces of content, and do that without duplication of paragraphs. Editing one synchronized block updates information in the linked block in all places of occurrence, creating a coherent knowledge database. Connections between such pieces of information can be represented as such a network reminiscent of neurons and can be legitimately called a second brain. By using such tools, humans can outsource long-term information storage to an external system.
