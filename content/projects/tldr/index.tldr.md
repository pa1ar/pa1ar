## what - summarizing articles right from your default browser on iOS and MacOS
The problem - you are reading an article and you are not sure if it is worth your time. You can either read it all or skip it. The first option is time consuming and the second one is risky. The solution - a browser extension that will summarize the article for you.  

The extension will be available for Safari on iOS/iPadOS and MacOS.  

## current state

## notable features ::  

- summary is stored locally, so if you revisit the website - you can read previously created one (not need to summarize again → money saving)
- works on iOS and MacOS
- uses your own OpenAI key - no subscription, pay for what you actually used  


## availability
It should be ready soon, testing it currently and polishing design.

## price
The plan is to release it for free, but you will require to bring your own OpenAI key. 
I might add optional features which will be available as one-time purchase:

- ability to ask follow up questions
- alter system prompt  

etc.
