# what  

Currently, only deaths in hospitals are reported, which is seen as inadequate for health research and planning. The register was suggested in the paper, which would benefit various groups, including quality management, health system designers, citizens, and service providers. It could also uphold the moral principles of medical care.

Sometimes we think that government has it all figured out, as well as the healthcare professionals. But then you find out that one or another obvious construct does not exist even as concept.
