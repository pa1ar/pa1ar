## what  
An adaptation of a spike sorting algorithm (published [earlier](/projects/spike-sorting) by our research group) was performed in order to analyze ECG.
Preliminary results show that a “spike sorting” of single ECG signals is possible, i.e. a sorting of P-waves, QRScomplexes, and T-waves. The clustering results indicate that differentiation between normal and anomalous P-waves, QRS-complexes, and T-waves is possible.
